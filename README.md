University Hub

University Hub is an App to connect the administration and the students through a simplified webapp . The Schema currently includes three different sections including the announcements section , the general discussion section and the semester forum .
The Announcements
The Announcement section include the official announcements from the university side and only has the write permission from the university side. The announcements section have an reaction counter to note the up votes and down votes to receive a feedback from the students side.
2. The General Discussion
The General Discussion Section Include a topic raised by any particular student or a faculty member and a followup thread of comments by the students or may interfered by the college Administration .
3. The Semester Forum
The Semester Forum includes all the talk about the current semester which may include syllabus discussion , exam tips from the faculty , sharing of semester notes , important papers and references and other semester linked stuff.
Thus , University Hub unlike any other college website is a common interactive link between various universities and their students in a more simplified and sorted manner.
